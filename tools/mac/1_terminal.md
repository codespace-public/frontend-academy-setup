Setup for Mac OS X
------------------

This guide will help you setup a software development environment on <a href="https://www.apple.com/osx/" target="_blank">Mac OS X 10.9 Mavericks</a> and above. By the end, your computer will be configured with the same state-of-the-art tools used by professional software developers.

This guide is mostly compatible with older versions of Mac OS X. So follow along as best you can while Googling any problems you come across.


### The Terminal

Included in Mac OS X is the **Terminal**—an app that runs a Unix shell.

A **Unix shell** (often referred to as a "terminal") is a command line user interface between you and your computer's operating system. In a Unix shell, you can type in commands that tell the computer to do many things: navigate to files and folders, install and run programs, and change configurations. Programmers rely on their Unix shells to do lots of work, quickly and easily.

You're probably most familiar with the graphical user interface (the "GUI") of your computer's operating system. Those are the boxes, windows, and menu items that you click on with your mouse. While that's technically a shell too, most programmers think of the textual, command line interface when they hear to word _shell_.


### Change the Terminal Profile

The default profile for the Terminal uses small, black text on a white background. Boring! Let's change that.

1. In the Terminal app, navigate to the `Terminal > Preferences` menu item.
1. In the preferences window, click the `Settings` Pane.
1. On the left side, scroll to the bottom, select the `Pro` profile, and click the `Default` button. ![](https://i.imgur.com/TQmcT8A.png)
1. Finally, quit and relaunch the Terminal.
